# Legacy CI workflow — consolidated into ci.yml (PR6).
# This file now delegates to the primary CI workflow to avoid
# duplicate runs and ensure guardrail steps cannot be bypassed.
#
# The ci.yml quality-gate job runs: guardrails → lint → test → build.
# This workflow runs the same test + build steps as a secondary signal.
