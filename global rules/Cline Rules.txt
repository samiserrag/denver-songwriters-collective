# GLOBAL WORKSPACE RULES FOR CLINE\
# ===============================\
\
# ---- GENERAL BEHAVIOR ----\
- Never guess or infer missing files, paths, or components.\
- If a referenced file does not exist EXACTLY as written, STOP and report.\
- Never create alternate files or alternate paths unless explicitly instructed.\
- Never refactor, reorganize, move, rename, or delete files unless explicitly instructed.\
- Keep all changes as small and surgical as possible.\
\
# ---- EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS ----\
- Do NOT run build, dev, or lint unless explicitly instructed.\
- Do NOT run database migrations, Supabase commands, pg_dump, or destructive ops unless explicitly instructed.\
- Do NOT \'93optimize,\'94 rewrite, or restructure any existing code.\
- Do NOT introduce new libraries without explicit approval.\
\
# ---- DIFF & EDITING RULES ----\
- When editing a file:\
  - Only modify the exact lines needed.\
  - Do not touch unrelated imports, whitespace, comments, or formatting.\
  - Preserve all existing code style and layout.\
  - After editing, always show ONLY the resulting diff.\
\
# ---- LOGIC & SAFETY ----\
- Never invent behavior, variable names, types, or components that were not already present.\
- If something is ambiguous, STOP and ask for clarification.\
- If a task conflicts with earlier rules, follow these Global Rules first.\
\
# ---- TESTING & READ-ONLY TASKS ----\
- For audits or analyses:\
  - Never modify files.\
  - Never generate synthetic code changes.\
  - Only read and report findings.\
\
# ---- LOOP PREVENTION ----\
- After completing a task:\
  - STOP.\
  - Wait for next instructions.\
  - Do NOT re-run commands unless explicitly instructed.\
  - Do NOT assume additional steps.\
\
# ---- TOOL EXECUTION ----\
- When executing commands:\
  - Use exactly the command given.\
  - Do not substitute, adjust, or \'93fix\'94 the command.\
  - If a command fails, STOP and report the error exactly.\
\
# ---- USER INTENT PRIORITY ----\
- Sami\'92s explicit step-by-step instructions override general assumptions.\
- Never predict the next step; always wait for direct approval.\
\
# ---- OPEN MIC DROP PROJECT RULES ----\
- Strictly forbidden:\
  - Moving files\
  - Renaming components\
  - Changing architecture\
  - Adding dependencies without approval\
  - Touching authentication or middleware unless explicitly instructed\

\cf0 - Never refactor, rename, or reorganize anything unless the user explicitly instructs it.\
- Never guess required files; stop and ask for clarification.\

\cf0 - Allowed:\
  - Small, isolated edits\
- Edits must be atomic, clear, and confined to ONLY the files explicitly listed by the user.\
- Multi-file changes are allowed IF the user explicitly requests them in the same task.\
- Larger feature work is allowed, but must be broken down into discrete, reviewable steps.\
  - Running build/lint when explicitly instructed\
  - Creating tests when explicitly instructed\
