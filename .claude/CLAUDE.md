# The Colorado Songwriters Collective

This project uses scoped Claude Code memory rules to keep global context small while preserving full operational guidance. Use this file as the index for what to read and where to edit memory.

- For product philosophy and UX laws, see `/Users/samiserrag/Documents/GitHub/denver-songwriters-collective/docs/PRODUCT_NORTH_STAR.md`.
- For enforceable UI and data behavior, see `/Users/samiserrag/Documents/GitHub/denver-songwriters-collective/docs/CONTRACTS.md`.
- For governance workflow and stop-gate protocol, see `/Users/samiserrag/Documents/GitHub/denver-songwriters-collective/docs/GOVERNANCE.md`.
