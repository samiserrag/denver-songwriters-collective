# Denver Songwriters Collective

## Copy Tone Guide (v1.0)

### Purpose

Ensure all copy feels **human, trustworthy, welcoming, and action-oriented**, while clearly signaling that DSC is **shared community infrastructure**, not a personal brand or a SaaS funnel.

This guide governs **what the site sounds like**, not what features do.

---

## Core Voice (Always True)

**DSC sounds like:**

- a calm host
- a friendly stage manager
- a community organizer who respects people's time
- someone who's done this before and isn't stressed about it

**DSC does NOT sound like:**

- a startup pitch
- a corporate platform
- a personal blog
- a hype machine
- a club with an inner circle

---

## Tone Pillars (in priority order)

### 1. Clear > Clever

Clarity always wins.
If a sentence could cause confusion at a venue, cut it.

### 2. Welcoming, Not Promotional

The site invites participation; it does not sell itself.

Good:

> “Hosted by songwriters, venues, and groups across Denver.”

Avoid:

> “The premier destination for serious songwriters.”

### 3. Community-First, Not “We-First”

Prefer **who this is for** over **who built it**.

Use:

- “Denver songwriters”
- “local hosts”
- “venues and groups”
- “the community”

Avoid overusing:

- “we”
- “our mission”
- “our platform”

### 4. Light, Human Warmth (Small Doses Only)

A little informality is good.
Jokes are not the goal — *reassurance is*.

Tone should reduce anxiety, not draw attention to itself.

---

## Humor & Informality Rules

### Allowed (sparingly)

- Empty states
- Helper text
- About page
- Low-stakes explanations

Examples:

- “Someone's gotta go first.”
- “If you've got a mic and a room, this probably counts.”
- “Finished song optional. Curiosity required.”

### Not Allowed

- Lineup order
- Time/date/location
- RSVP confirmations
- Host controls
- Anything shown on a venue TV

Rule of thumb:

> If it would feel weird read aloud at an open mic, don't use it.

---

## Language Style

### Sentence Length

- Short
- Conversational
- One idea per sentence

### Vocabulary

- Plain English
- Music-scene familiar
- No jargon unless unavoidable

Avoid:

- “optimize”
- “leverage”
- “ecosystem”
- “solution”

Prefer:

- “show up”
- “play live”
- “host”
- “join”
- “this week”

---

## Calls to Action (CTAs)

**CTAs are verbs. Always.**

Approved primary CTAs:

- RSVP
- See events
- See open mics
- See lineup
- Host an event
- Submit an event

Avoid:

- Learn more
- Discover
- Explore
- Get started

---

## Discovery Tone

Discovery should feel:

- organic
- local
- non-competitive

Use:

- “Featured”
- “Community spotlight”
- “Recently played”

Avoid:

- rankings
- “top”
- “best”
- popularity language

---

## Trust & Data Tone

When mentioning emails or data:

- calm
- factual
- non-defensive

Example:

> “Email is used to run the event, then it disappears.”

Never joke about:

- privacy
- data
- reliability

---

## Emotional Target

After reading DSC copy, a visitor should feel:

- “I can show up here.”
- “This isn't intimidating.”
- “This isn't trying to sell me something.”
- “This feels run by real people.”

---

## One-Sentence Summary (for agents)

> **Write like a calm, friendly host who wants people to show up this week — not like a brand trying to impress them.**

---

If you want next, I can:

- turn this into a **lint-style checklist** for future copy edits
- annotate **exact spots on the site** where humor is allowed vs not
- or create a **“before/after” copy diff** for one key page to set the pattern
