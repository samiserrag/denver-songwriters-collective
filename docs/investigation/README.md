# Investigation Documents

> **Archived:** Investigations are now located at [`docs/archived/investigations/`](../archived/investigations/)

Completed phase notes are archived to keep active docs clean. New investigations should still be created here during active development, then moved to the archive when the phase is complete.

## Creating New Investigations

During active development, create investigation documents here following the naming convention:

```
docs/investigation/phase{X}-{name}.md
```

Once the phase is complete and merged, move the document to `docs/archived/investigations/`.
