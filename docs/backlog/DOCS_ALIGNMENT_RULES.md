# Docs Alignment Rules

1. `docs/BACKLOG.md` is the only canonical backlog.
2. Every active tract must have one stable ID (for example `UX-06`, `GROWTH-01`).
3. All priorities and statuses are edited in `docs/BACKLOG.md` first.
4. `docs/backlog/post-gtm-3-1-active-backlog.md` is index-only and must link to canonical IDs.
5. STOP-GATE docs live in `docs/investigation/` and are linked from canonical entries.
6. `CLAUDE.md` is operational history, not backlog authority.
7. `docs/CONTRACTS.md` is authoritative for enforceable behavior contracts.
8. Closed tracts remain documented but must be marked CLOSED/COMPLETE consistently.
9. GTM-3.1 is closed; new work must not silently reopen it.
10. If two docs conflict, align to `docs/BACKLOG.md` and add a note in `CLAUDE.md` Recent Changes.
11. No execution language without stop-gate approval from Sami.
12. Keep links relative and verify paths after edits.
