# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation preserved for reference. These documents are no longer actively maintained but are kept for context and audit purposes.

## Contents

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [investigations/](./investigations/) | Completed phase investigation documents (48 files) |
| [completed/](./completed/) | Historical completed work and specs |
| [future-specs/](./future-specs/) | Long-term vision documents |
| [ops/](./ops/) | Historical ops scripts and notes |
| [consultation/](./consultation/) | External consultation notes |
| [deprecated/](./deprecated/) | Documents superseded by canonical docs |
| [tests-legacy-schema/](./tests-legacy-schema/) | Archived legacy test files |

## Why Archive?

Completed phase notes are archived to keep active docs clean. This:

- Reduces noise in the active docs directory
- Preserves git history for all moved files
- Maintains audit trail for past decisions
- Keeps canonical docs focused and discoverable

## Canonical Docs

For current documentation, see the [docs README](../README.md).

Active documents live in the parent `docs/` directory:
- `BACKLOG.md` — Active backlog
- `CONTRACTS.md` — UI/data contracts
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — Stop-gate workflow
- `known-issues.md` — Bug tracking
